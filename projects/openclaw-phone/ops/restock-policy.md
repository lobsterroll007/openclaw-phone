> **Restocking & Returns**

A **$30 restocking fee** applies to every approved return to cover the time required to securely wipe, reconfigure, and QA the device. Shipping costs are non-refundable. Once we receive and verify the phone, we issue your refund (minus shipping + restock fee) within 3 business days.
