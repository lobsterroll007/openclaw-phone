## FAQ
**How do returns work?**
You have 14 days from delivery to try the OpenClaw Phone. If you return it in its original condition with all accessories, we refund your purchase minus a flat $30 restock fee. This covers wiping the device, QA, and repackaging.

**Is my data secure?**
Yes. API keys live in encrypted storage on the device. Messaging happens only through the channels you authorize (Telegram, Signal). You can factory reset from the OpenClaw app anytime before shipping the phone back.

**What support do I get?**
Every order includes email and Telegram support (Mon–Fri, 9a–6p MT). Concierge buyers also receive a live onboarding call and priority chat line for the first month.

**Do I need to be technical?**
No. The phone arrives prepped. You just join Wi-Fi, drop in your AI key, and send a first test message. The quick-start insert plus our guide walk you through it in plain language.

**Can I switch AI providers later?**
Absolutely. Open the OpenClaw app → Settings → API keys to update or swap providers anytime.

Add final CTA banner: “Ready to move faster? Grab your OpenClaw Phone today.”
