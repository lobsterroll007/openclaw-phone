## 1. 30-Minute Concierge Call Script
**Goal:** Have the customer fully operational, confident in daily use, and aware of next steps by the end of the call.

### Structure Overview
| Segment | Time | Owner |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Warm welcome & goals | 3 min | Concierge Lead |
| Hardware + Wi-Fi check | 5 min | Concierge Lead (customer shares screen/camera) |
| OpenClaw setup walkthrough | 12 min | Concierge Lead guiding customer |
| Messaging link + first test | 7 min | Customer performs, concierge observes |
| Wrap + next steps | 3 min | Concierge Lead |

### Detailed Script
1. **Welcome (3 min)**
   - “Thanks for choosing the Concierge kit! Today we’ll connect Wi-Fi, drop in your API key, link Telegram/Signal, and send a first message.”
   - Confirm preferred communication channel for support follow-ups.

2. **Hardware & Wi-Fi (5 min)**
   - Ensure the phone is plugged in and powered.
   - Walk the customer through joining Wi-Fi (double-check password entry).
   - Verify connection by loading a webpage.

3. **OpenClaw Setup (12 min)**
   - Launch **OpenClaw Setup** together.
   - Review permissions pop-ups; explain why each is needed in plain language.
   - Guide API key entry:
     - Confirm the customer has the key ready.
     - Watch them paste/type it, then tap **Verify**.
     - Note success or troubleshoot errors immediately.
   - Customize basic preferences (timezone, notification style, voice vs. text default).

4. **Messaging Link + Test (7 min)**
   - Decide which channel (Telegram, Signal, both) they’ll use first.
   - Stay on the line while they log in and approve the OpenClaw bot.
   - Prompt them to send the scripted first message: “Hey OpenClaw, can you summarize my day in 3 bullets?”
   - Confirm the reply arrives. Screenshot placeholder: `[Add screenshot of successful first reply]`.

5. **Wrap-Up (3 min)**
   - Recap what’s working: Wi-Fi ✅, API key ✅, messaging ✅, first message ✅.
   - Highlight the quick-start insert and onboarding hub URL.
   - Set expectations: “I’ll email you the recap + links in a few minutes. Reply there or DM @OpenClawSupport if anything pops up.”

### Notes for Concierge Lead
- Keep jargon out of the conversation; use analogies (“API key is like your account password for the AI”).
- Log any confusion or repeated questions in the weekly feedback doc.
- If troubleshooting extends beyond 30 minutes, set a follow-up slot rather than rushing.
