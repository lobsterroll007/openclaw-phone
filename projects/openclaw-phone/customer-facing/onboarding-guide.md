# OpenClaw Phone Onboarding Guide
_Direct, friendly, and built for non-technical humans._

> **Before you start:** Have your Wi-Fi password, preferred AI API key (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.), and Telegram/Signal login handy. Keep the included charger connected so the phone stays powered during setup.

---

## 1. Meet Your OpenClaw Phone
- Purpose-built Android handset with OpenClaw already installed.
- Dedicated messaging apps (Telegram + Signal) pinned to the dock.
- “OpenClaw Setup” shortcut on the home screen launches everything you need.

## 2. Step-by-Step Setup

### Step 1 – Connect to Wi-Fi
1. Press the power button, unlock with the default PIN (####) shown on the shipping slip.
2. Swipe down twice → tap and hold the **Wi-Fi** tile.
3. Select your network → enter the password → **Connect**.
4. Wait for the “Connected” badge before moving on.

> **Tip:** If you use a guest network, make sure it allows device-to-internet access without captive portals.

### Step 2 – Launch the OpenClaw Setup Wizard
1. Tap the **OpenClaw Setup** icon.
2. Accept permissions for notifications, microphone, and storage.
3. When prompted, confirm your timezone so scheduled tasks line up with you.

### Step 3 – Add Your AI Provider
1. Choose OpenAI, Anthropic, or “Custom API”.
2. Paste your API key (long string starting with `sk-` or similar).
3. Tap **Verify Key**. If successful, you’ll see a green check.
4. The wizard stores the key securely in encrypted storage on the device.

**Troubleshooting:** If you see “Invalid key,” double-check for trailing spaces or expired keys. Contact your AI provider dashboard if you need to regenerate one.

### Step 4 – Link Telegram or Signal (or both)
1. On the “Messaging Channels” screen, pick Telegram first.
2. Tap **Link Telegram** → the Telegram app opens.
3. Sign in using your phone number and code.
4. Approve the OpenClaw bot when prompted. You’ll see a “Connected” badge.
5. Repeat the process for Signal if you use it.

> **Privacy note:** All messages route through your chosen app. OpenClaw never shares your contacts or chat history.

### Step 5 – Send Your First Message
1. Tap the **First Message** shortcut on the home screen.
2. Type “Hey OpenClaw, what can you help me with this week?”
3. You should receive a reply within a few seconds. The wizard logs this step as complete.
4. Pin this conversation for easy access later.

### Step 6 – Optional Concierge Call
- If you purchased the **Concierge Tier ($180)**, book your 30-minute onboarding call using the link in your confirmation email.
- The specialist will remote-walk through any sticking points and customize prompts with you.

## 3. Daily Use Cheatsheet
- **Ask clearly:** “Create a daily standup summary using these bullet points…” works better than “help?”
- **Share context:** Paste links, documents, or short bullet lists before requesting an action.
- **Voice options:** Hold the microphone icon in Telegram/Signal to send a quick voice memo; OpenClaw transcribes automatically.
- **Attachments:** Photos/screenshots forward fine. Mention what you want done (e.g., “Summarize the attached notes”).

## 4. Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Quick Fix |
| --- | --- |
| Bot isn’t replying | Confirm Wi-Fi is connected → reopen OpenClaw app → send `/ping`. If still silent, reboot phone. |
| API key error | Reopen **OpenClaw Setup** → Settings → **API Keys** → re-enter your key. Make sure billing is active with your AI provider. |
| Telegram messages stuck at “Sending” | Check Telegram’s status bar for “Connecting…”. Toggle Airplane mode on/off, or switch to Signal temporarily. |
| Voice prompts fail | Ensure microphone permission is enabled (Settings → Apps → OpenClaw → Permissions). |
| Battery drains fast | Reduce screen brightness, close unused apps, and keep the charger connected during heavy use.
