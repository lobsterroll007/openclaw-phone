# Payment & Confirmation Flow – OpenClaw Phone

## 1. Customer Says "Yes"
1. **Confirm Offer Tier & Timeline**
   - Reply with summary: `"Got it — locking you in for the $130 Base ($180 Concierge) package. Next available 2-hour prep block is {{date/time}}."`
   - If special device/color requested, mention `$30 restock fee` and confirm acceptance before proceeding.
2. **Update CRM**
   - Stage → `Qualified`
   - Add tentative prep block in calendar + notes

## 2. Send Payment Instructions
Share payment block tailored to customer preference (copy/paste from below):
```
Choose whichever is easiest — just include "OpenClaw Phone" in the note so we track it:
• Cash (local handoff) – pay at pickup/drop-off, you'll get a written + digital receipt
• Cash App – $openclawops
• Venmo – @OpenClawOps (toggle purchases on)
• Zelle – finance@openclaw.co

Total: ${amount} (includes restock fee if applicable). Once it's sent, screenshot or forward the confirmation and I'll mark your prep slot.
```
- Reminder: Concierge tier requires intake form (apps/login instructions). Send link immediately after payment confirmation.

## 3. Verify Payment
1. Check incoming notification or screenshot
2. Record transaction ID/memo in CRM `Notes`
3. Stage → `Paid`, update `Last Updated`

## 4. Send Confirmation Template
```
Payment received ✅

You're booked for the {{date/time}} prep block (2 hours). Here's what happens next:
1. Complete intake form: {{link}}
2. We'll prep the device, QA it, and document settings
3. Handoff/ship ETA: {{handoff date}}

If anything changes, reply here — otherwise expect a confirmation with either pickup instructions or tracking as soon as it's shipped.
```
- For concierge: add `"We'll confirm any app credentials via secure note before we start."`

## 5. Prep & Handoff
- Follow phone-prep checklist; keep actual work within 2-hour window.
- Upon completion, send delivery message with proof (photos, tracking #, or pickup instructions) and move stage → `Shipped`.

## 6. Post-Delivery Follow-up
- 3 days after delivery: Stage → `Follow-up`
- Send template:
```
How's the OpenClaw Phone treating you? Anything to tweak?
If it's working great, mind dropping a quick testimonial or referring someone who needs the "OpenClaw brain without the setup headache"? I can reserve them a slot next week.
```
- Log any referrals + schedule incentives.

## Notes & Safeguards
- Never start prep without confirmed payment
- If prep calendar is full, offer to waitlist or upsell concierge priority (if sustainable)
- Maintain consistent timestamps in CRM to audit turnaround as we push prep time below 2 hours
