# Lead Sourcing Plan – OpenClaw Phone

## Capacity Guardrails
- **Prep bandwidth:** 2-hour prep per device, currently 2–3 blocks/day max
- **Weekly target:** 6–8 closed phones while maintaining QA
- All outreach cadences below should flag a hard stop once calendar holds are full; push new leads to waitlist with expected reopen date

---

## 1. Friends & Family Tree
- **Audience:** Warm contacts already aware of OpenClaw projects
- **Channel Mechanics:** Personalized texts/DMs referencing shared context ("you mentioned needing a backup device last month")
- **Cadence:**
  - Week 1: Reach out to 10 priority contacts (5 texts/day)
  - Week 2+: Follow-up 5–7 days later if no reply; share testimonials once available
- **Success Metrics:**
  - 60% response rate (warm)
  - 30% booking rate (3 orders/week)
- **Notes:** Use this pool to backstop gaps in the schedule; fast trust = low friction payments

## 2. Local Groups & Meetups
- **Audience:** Boise-area founders, gig workers, repair shops
- **Channels:** Facebook Marketplace groups, neighborhood Discords, startup Slack, local repair meetup boards
- **Cadence:**
  - Post 2 value-driven blurbs per week (Tue/Thu) capped at "2 prep slots" CTA to match capacity
  - Attend at least one meetup/month and offer onsite demos with sample device
  - DMs within 12 hours of any comment/interest
- **Success Metrics:**
  - 5 qualified convos/week
  - 2 paid orders/week sourced locally
- **Notes:** Emphasize quick handoff + option for physical cash payment at pickup. Align posts with inventory (share photos of current devices).

## 3. Online Communities (Operators & Automation Nerds)
- **Audience:** Ops chats, automation forums, indie hacker discords where OpenClaw reputation exists
- **Channels:**
  - r/Entrepreneur ride-along threads (where allowed)
  - Automation/AI Discord partner channels (ask mods for promo day)
  - Twitter/X replies under relevant tool builders (value comment + CTA in DM)
- **Cadence:**
  - 3 "value first" contributions/day (answering setup questions, sharing prep checklist snippet)
  - 2 direct outreach DMs/day triggered by pain-point mentions ("need backup phone")
- **Success Metrics:**
  - 10 new leads/week entering CRM
  - 2 concierge-tier conversions/week
- **Notes:** Highlight "OpenClaw without the setup headache" and stress that concierge tier removes all onboarding friction.

## 4. Referral Multipliers
- **Audience:** Satisfied buyers + partner operators
- **Mechanics:** Post-prep follow-up includes referral ask + $20 credit (or rush slot) for each new customer
- **Cadence:**
  - Trigger at Follow-up stage (3 days post delivery)
  - Monthly reminder email/DM listing open prep slots
- **Success Metrics:**
  - 25% of Follow-up customers send 1+ referrals
  - 1 incremental order/week from referrals
