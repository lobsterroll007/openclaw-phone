## 1. DM / Email Pitch Template
```
Hey {{first_name}} — saw you're juggling way too much tech setup right now. We just launched the OpenClaw Phone service: you send us the specs you need, we handle everything and hand back a ready-to-use phone.

Options:
• $130 Base: we source, wipe, optimize, and deliver a clean device ready to load your own accounts
• $180 Concierge: all of the above + white-glove install of the exact apps/profiles you specify, documented handoff

We only take what we can prep in our 2-hour turnaround block, so let me know what you're looking for and I'll reserve a slot. If you need a specific model/color that's not in stock there's just a $30 restock fee.

Want me to save you a spot this week?

**Follow-up angle (48h later):**
```
Quick nudge — I've got one prep slot left tomorrow. If you still want the plug-and-play OpenClaw phone, just reply "LOCK IT" and I'll send over payment + intake.

## 3. Social / Referral Blurb
```
Friends keep asking how I'm spinning up turnkey phones so fast — it's the new **OpenClaw Phone** service. $130 gets you a prepped device, $180 adds concierge install, and if you need a specific color/model it's just $30 extra. I'm only booking a couple 2-hour prep blocks per day, so DM me "PHONE" if you want in before they fill.
```

Add CTA variations:
- **Instagram Story:** "Need a plug-and-play OpenClaw phone? DM PHONE."
- **Community Post:** "Offering 2 prep slots this week — comment ✅ for details."

## Quick Objection Handles
- **"Can I DIY cheaper?"** → "Totally, but you'll give up 2-3 hours. We keep it to a scheduled 2-hour block and deliver a known-good device."
- **"Why the restock fee?"** → "It just covers sourcing exactly what you requested when it's outside our current inventory."
- **"How fast can I get it?"** → "We can usually prep next-day as long as a 2-hour block is open. Concierge installs sometimes need one extra day for QA."

Keep tone friendly, confident, and operational: you're the plug who makes OpenClaw hardware painless.
