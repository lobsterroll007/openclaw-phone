# OpenClaw Phone – Unit Economics (Draft)

_Last updated: 2026-02-23_

## Assumptions (update as we learn more)
- **Device:** Motorola XT2513v (Walmart) – $32 per unit (your cost)
- **Customer price:** $130 base bundle (device + OpenClaw preconfig)
- **Concierge add-on:** +$50 for live setup (optional)
- **Labor:** ~2 hours hands-on prep per outbound unit (reset, install, QA). Returns require another ~2 hours to refurbish before resale.
- **Packaging:** Re-using OEM box; only incremental material is a single printed letter insert (pennies per unit).
- **Payment methods (initial):** Cash, Cash App, Venmo, Zelle → effectively zero processing fees but higher manual tracking overhead.
- **Customer covers:** sales tax + shipping (pass-through).
- **Returns:** Accepted if phone is like-new; charge restocking fee (TBD) but still incur 2-hour reset cost.

## Baseline Margin (no concierge)
- Revenue: **$130**
- COGS (device): **$32**
- **Gross Margin (pre-labor):** $98 (**75.4%**)

### Labor-adjusted view (example rates)
| Hourly rate | Labor cost (2h) | Net margin (base) | Net margin (concierge) |
|-------------|-----------------|-------------------|-------------------------|
| $20/hr      | $40             | $58 (44.6%)       | $108 (60.0%)            |
| $30/hr      | $60             | $38 (29.2%)       | $88 (48.9%)             |
| $40/hr      | $80             | $18 (13.8%)       | $68 (37.8%)             |

_Adjust table once you decide how to value your time or if you delegate to someone else at a different rate._

## With Concierge Add-on
- Revenue: **$180**
- COGS (device): **$32**
- **Gross Margin (pre-labor):** $148 (**82.2%**)
- **Concierge labor:** add estimated 0.75 hr live call + prep (value at same hourly rate); update table when we lock the actual duration.

## Sensitivity (device cost changes)
| Device Cost | Base Margin | Concierge Margin |
|-------------|-------------|------------------|
| $32         | $98 (75%)   | $148 (82%)       |
| $40         | $90 (69%)   | $140 (78%)       |
| $50         | $80 (62%)   | $130 (72%)       |

## Returns & Refurbishment Impact
- Each return consumes another **2 hours** of labor to factory reset and reconfigure.
- Recommend minimum **restocking fee = device depreciation + labor value** (e.g., $75 if labor valued at $20/hr) to avoid losing money.
- Track return rate; even a 10% return rate could shave 7–10 pts off margin if the fee doesn’t cover labor.

## Next Inputs Needed
1. Target hourly value for your time (or cost of hired help) to finalize labor-adjusted profitability.
2. Desired restocking fee amount and expected return rate.
3. Future payment processor fees once we move beyond cash app methods (Stripe, Shopify, etc.).
4. Marketing spend per acquisition once we start running ads or affiliates.

Once we have these, we can lock per-unit profitability, breakeven volumes, and pricing levers.
